# Object Store in MuleSoft

## Overview
Object Store in MuleSoft is a service for storing and retrieving transient data. It is useful for scenarios where you need to temporarily store data, such as caching, session storage, and state management.

## Key Features
- **Key-Value Storage:** Stores data as key-value pairs.
- **Time-to-Live (TTL):** Allows setting an expiration time for stored entries.
- **Persistence:** Options for in-memory or persistent storage.
- **Clustering:** Support for clustered deployments.

## Use Cases
- **Caching:** Store frequently accessed data to reduce computation or retrieval times.
- **Session Management:** Maintain user session data across different components of an application.
- **State Management:** Keep track of stateful information in stateless architectures.
