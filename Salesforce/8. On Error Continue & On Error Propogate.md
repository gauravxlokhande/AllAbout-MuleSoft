in above example (first flow) (variable) execute and by using (flow ref) it goes in (second flow) then (In request) error occured then it enters in (error block) and go inside (On error continue) and as it return success it go to (flow one) forwards (flow ref) (msg transform) and end.

if insted of (continue) there is (propogate) then it returns error then it goes in (first flow) and go in (error block) and execute all steps in erro block and end.
