   - **API Documentation:** It helps in generating and managing API documentation, including specifying request and response payloads to illustrate how APIs work.
   - **API Mocking:** It can generate mock APIs to simulate API behavior and test integrations without accessing real backend systems.

2. **Anypoint Studio (Desktop IDE):**
   - **Integration Development:** Anypoint Studio is used for actual integration development. Developers use it to build APIs and integrations using drag-and-drop components, connectors, and visual tools.
   - **Data Mapping and Transformation:** It includes tools for mapping data between different formats, transforming data, and applying business logic within integration flows.
   - **Testing and Debugging:** Anypoint Studio provides capabilities for testing integrations locally, debugging issues, and ensuring the functionality of APIs before deployment.
