# MuleSoft 


### Who & what is MuleSoft?
MuleSoft provides the most widely used integration platform for connecting SaaS & enterprise applications in the cloud and on-premise.
Back in 2018, MuleSoft was acquired by Salesforce primarily to accelerate customers digital transformations. MuleSoft's integration platform enables not only to unlock data across legacy systems, cloud apps and devices but also to make smarter and faster decisions, and offer highly connected experiences for end-users.
MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform is now a part of the Salesforce Integration Cloud. Conversely, MuleSoft has a pre-built connector into Salesforce for seamless integration.
