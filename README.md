# MuleSoft 


### Who & what is MuleSoft?
MuleSoft provides the most widely used integration platform for connecting SaaS & enterprise applications in the cloud and on-premise.
Back in 2018, MuleSoft was acquired by Salesforce primarily to accelerate customers digital transformations. MuleSoft's integration platform enables not only to unlock data across legacy systems, cloud apps and devices but also to make smarter and faster decisions, and offer highly connected experiences for end-users.
MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform is now a part of the Salesforce Integration Cloud. Conversely, MuleSoft has a pre-built connector into Salesforce for seamless integration.

### What Is RAML?
RAML stands for RESTful API Modeling Language, which is a YAML-based language for describing APIs. It was developed by MuleSoft in 2013 and is now owned by Salesforce. RAML is used to model APIs, not just document them, and can help developers create efficient API management strategies. It's concise and reusable, and can be used to manage the API lifecycle from design to deployment to sharing. 
RAML is designed to describe APIs in a way that's readable by both humans and computers. It focuses on describing resources, methods, parameters, responses, media types, and other HTTP constructs that form the basis for modern APIs. RAML isn't strict, and can be used to describe APIs that obey many, but not all, RESTful constraints


```yaml
#%RAML 1.0
title: Hello world # required title

/greeting: # optional resource
  get: # HTTP method declaration
    responses: # declare a response
      200: # HTTP status code
        body: # declare content of response
          application/json: # media type
            # structural definition of a response (schema or type)
            type: object
            properties:
              message: string
            example: # example how a response looks like
              message: "Hello world"
```

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0
title: Hello World API # Title of the API

/greeting: # Define a resource at the path /greeting
  get: # HTTP GET method for the /greeting resource
    description: Returns a greeting message # Description of the GET method
    queryParameters: # Section to define query parameters
      name: # Define a query parameter named 'name'
        description: The name to include in the greeting message # Description of the 'name' query parameter
        type: string # Data type of the 'name' parameter, which is a string
        required: false # Indicates that the 'name' parameter is optional
    responses: # Section to define the responses for the GET method
      200: # HTTP status code for a successful response
        body: # Define the body of the response
          application/json: # Media type of the response body
            type: object # Define the structure of the response body as an object
            properties: # Properties of the response object
              message: string # 'message' property of type string
            example: # Example of a response
              message: "Hello, world" # Example response message
```




### RAML Components Explained

#### Resource
- **Definition**: A URI endpoint that your API exposes.
- **Example**: `/greeting` is a resource.
- **Purpose**: Resources represent entities or services that your API manages.

#### Method
- **Definition**: An HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used to interact with a resource.
- **Example**: `get` under `/greeting`.
- **Purpose**: Methods define actions that can be performed on resources.

#### Request
- **Definition**: The data sent to the API by the client.
- **Example**: Query parameters, headers, request body.
- **Purpose**: Provides input data for the API to process.

#### Response
- **Definition**: The data sent back from the API to the client.
- **Example**: JSON body, status code, headers.
- **Purpose**: Delivers the outcome of the API call to the client.

#### HTTP Status
- **Definition**: Standardized codes indicating the result of the HTTP request.
- **Example**: `200` for success, `404` for not found, `500` for server error.
- **Purpose**: Communicates the result of the request.

### RAML Example with Components

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0
title: Hello World API # Title of the API

/greeting: # Resource
  get: # Method
    description: Returns a greeting message # Description of the method
    queryParameters: # Request query parameters
      name: # Query parameter named 'name'
        description: The name to include in the greeting message # Description of the query parameter
        type: string # Type of the query parameter
        required: false # Whether the query parameter is required
    responses: # Responses for the GET method
      200: # HTTP status code for a successful response
        body: # Response body
          application/json: # Media type of the response body
            type: object # Structure of the response body
            properties: # Properties of the response body
              message: string # 'message' property of type string
            example: # Example of a response
              message: "Hello, world" # Example response message
```

### Explanation of Each Component

1. **Resource**:
   - Defined by `/greeting`.
   - Represents the endpoint for greeting messages.

2. **Method**:
   - Defined by `get` under `/greeting`.
   - Specifies that this endpoint supports HTTP GET requests.

3. **Request**:
   - Defined under `queryParameters` with the parameter `name`.
   - The `name` parameter can be included in the query string to customize the greeting message.

4. **Response**:
   - Defined under `responses` with HTTP status `200`.
   - Specifies the expected response body when the request is successful.

5. **HTTP Status**:
   - `200`: Indicates the request was successful.
   - Other potential statuses (not shown here) might include `404` (Not Found) or `500` (Internal Server Error) for other scenarios.

### Adding Components for Reusability

To make the RAML file more modular, you can use data types and traits.

#### Data Type for Response

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0
title: Hello World API
types:
  GreetingResponse:
    type: object
    properties:
      message: string

/greeting:
  get:
    description: Returns a greeting message
    queryParameters:
      name:
        description: The name to include in the greeting message
        type: string
        required: false
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            type: GreetingResponse
            example:
              message: "Hello, world"
```

### Explanation of Added Component

1. **types**:
   - Defines reusable data types.
   - `GreetingResponse`: A type defining the structure of the response body.
   
Using the `GreetingResponse` type makes the API definition cleaner and more maintainable, as the response structure is defined in one place and can be reused across multiple endpoints if needed.




Sure! Below is the modified RAML example formatted for inclusion in a `README.md` file on GitHub.

### Hello World API

This API provides a simple greeting message.

#### RAML Specification

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0

  GreetingResponse:
    type: object
    properties:
      message: string

/greeting:
  get:
    description: Returns a greeting message
    queryParameters:

        required: false
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            type: GreetingResponse
            example:
              message: "Hello, world"
```

### Explanation of Components

1. **Resource**:
   - `/greeting`: The endpoint for greeting messages.

2. **Method**:
   - `GET`: Retrieves a greeting message.

3. **Request**:
   - **Query Parameters**:
     - `name` (optional, string): The name to include in the greeting message.

4. **Response**:
   - **200 OK**:
     - **Body**: JSON object with a `message` property.
     - **Example**:
       ```json
       {
         "message": "Hello, world"
       }
       ```

5. **Data Types**:
   - `GreetingResponse`: A reusable type defining the structure of the response body.

### Example Usage

- **Without query parameter**:
  ```
  GET http://api.library.com/greeting
  Response:
  {
    "message": "Hello, world"
  }
  ```

- **With query parameter**:
  ```
  GET http://api.library.com/greeting?name=John
  Response:
  {
    "message": "Hello, John"
  }
  ```

This README section should help users understand the structure and usage of your API, along with a clear example of how to make requests and what responses to expect.
